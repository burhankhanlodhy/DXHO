# Astrometry.net Upload Fix - Final Summary

## Issue Resolution

The astrometry.net API upload issue has been **successfully resolved**. The problem was caused by overly complex modifications that interfered with the working API format.

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Was Working:
- ✅ **Original API format**: `'application/fits'` MIME type
- ✅ **Simple session handling**: Basic requests.Session()  
- ✅ **Minimal request parameters**: Only essential parameters
- ✅ **Standard file streaming**: Using file handles directly

### What Broke It:
- ❌ **Changed MIME types**: Switching to `'image/fits'` caused 500 errors
- ❌ **Complex session configuration**: Over-engineered retry logic conflicted with server
- ❌ **Extra parameters**: Adding empty optional parameters confused the API
- ❌ **Pre-loading file data**: Reading entire file into memory caused issues

## Final Working Solution

### 1. Upload Format (Reverted to Working)
```python
with open(filepath, 'rb') as f:
    files = {
        'file': (os.path.basename(filepath), f, 'application/fits'),
        'request-json': (None, json.dumps(submission_data), 'application/json')
    }
    
    response = session.post(submit_url, files=files, timeout=600)
```

### 2. Simple Session Configuration
```python
def _setup_robust_session(self):
    session = requests.Session()
    session.headers.update({
        'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; DEHO Observatory)',
    })
    return session
```

### 3. Minimal Request Parameters
```python
submission_data = {
    "session": session_key,
    "allow_commercial_use": "d",
    "allow_modifications": "d", 
    "publicly_visible": "y",
    "scale_units": "degwidth",
    "scale_type": "ul",
    "scale_lower": 0.1,
    "scale_upper": 10
}
```

### 4. Non-blocking FITS Validation
```python
# Validate but don't block upload if validation fails
try:
    is_valid = self._validate_fits_for_astrometry(filepath)
    if not is_valid:
        logger.warning("FITS file validation failed, but proceeding anyway")
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"FITS validation error (proceeding anyway): {e}")
```

## Test Results

### Debug Testing:
```
Original format: SUCCESS - Submission ID 13058202
Web-compatible format: SUCCESS - Submission ID 13058203
```

### Photometry Module Testing:
```
[SUCCESS] Photometry module can upload to astrometry.net!
Upload successful: Submission ID 13058227
```

## What Was Retained from Improvements

While reverting the problematic changes, we kept these beneficial improvements:

1. **✅ Better Error Handling**: Enhanced logging and error detection
2. **✅ File Size Validation**: Prevents uploading oversized files
3. **✅ FITS File Validation**: Non-blocking validation with warnings
4. **✅ Retry Logic**: Simple exponential backoff for transient failures
5. **✅ Progress Updates**: Better GUI progress feedback

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Don't Over-Engineer Working APIs
The original format was working fine. The 500 errors were caused by the server not expecting the modified MIME types and request structure.

### 2. MIME Types Matter
- ✅ `'application/fits'` - **Works** (standard FITS MIME type)
- ❌ `'image/fits'` - **Fails** (not recognized by astrometry.net)
- ❌ `'application/octet-stream'` - **Works but suboptimal**

### 3. Keep API Requests Simple
Adding empty optional parameters can confuse servers. Stick to only the required parameters unless you have specific values to provide.

### 4. Test Incrementally
When making API changes, test each modification individually rather than changing everything at once.

## Current Status

### ✅ **WORKING**: 
- File uploads to astrometry.net API
- Login and session management  
- Error handling and retries
- FITS file validation (warnings only)
- Integration with photometry workflow

### ✅ **TESTED**:
- Small test files (23KB) - **SUCCESS**
- Medium test files (83KB) - **SUCCESS** 
- API login functionality - **SUCCESS**
- Multiple upload formats - **SUCCESS**

## Usage

The photometry module now works as expected:

```python
# This will now work correctly
photometry = Photometry()
sources, phot_table = photometry.photometry(fits_file_path, fwhm=5.0, threshold=3.0)
```

The astrometry.net integration is automatically called during photometry analysis and should no longer get stuck or fail with 500 errors.
